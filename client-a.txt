# Client Task A #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #
Pick a random number between 1 and 10 (let's call it secret_number)
Set attempts to 0

Repeat until the player guesses correctly or reaches 3 attempts:
Ask the player to enter a guess

Add 1 to attempts

If the guess is the same as secret_number:
Say "You Win!"

End the game

If the guess is higher or lower:
Say "Too high" or "Too low"

If the player doesn't guess in 3 tries:
Say "Game over! The correct number was secret_number."
