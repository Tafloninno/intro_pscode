Start at position (0, 0)

Set the target position (let's call it target_x, target_y)

While the current position isn't the target:
-Ask the player to choose a direction: north, south, east, or west
-If north, add 1 to y_position
-If south, subtract 1 from y_position
-If east, add 1 to x_position
-If west, subtract 1 from x_position

When the current position matches the target:
Say "You found the spot!"
